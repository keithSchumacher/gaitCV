# gaitCV

This repo contains code related to gait analysis. Training data was obtained via Youtube (youtube-dl). There is code to extract key points (feet, knees, etc.) of the runner frame by frame. OpenCV OpenPose was utilized. The project also utilized a neural network to classify the runners on physical traits, but the training set was too small (14 videos).
